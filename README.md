## ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM:
### The "ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM" rearranges a word's letters in alphabetical order. The `anyword(a)` function takes an input string, sorts the characters, and outputs a new sorted string after converting the string into a list. For example, the word "annyeong" turns into "aegnnnoy".
#
## EMOTICON PROBLEM:
### The "EMOTICON PROBLEM" converts specific words in a sentence to emoticons. The emote(phrase) function breaks the sentence up into words, inserts matching emoticons from a dictionary for some of the words, and then reassembles the words into a string. "Make me grin and sad," for example, becomes "Make me :D and :(."
#
## UNPACKING LIST PROBLEM:
### The "UNPACKING LIST PROBLEM" extracts specific parts of a list.  The first item, the last item, and the middle section (everything except the first and last) are accessed separately. For example, in the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, it prints "first: 1", "middle: [2, 3, 4, 5]", and "last: 6".

## How It's made:
### Tech used: Jupyter Notebook, Python
### The first programming assignment was made using the jupyter notebook and the Python language. The experiment introduces us to basic functions and codes that can be used for python. The experiment was created nicely and is working well with both techs used.
