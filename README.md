### Name: Mariane Iszley V. Samar
### Section: 2ECE-D
### Date Submitted: Aug. 29, 2024

## How It's made:
### Tech used: Jupyter Notebook, Python
### The first programming assignment was made by using the jupyter notebook and the Python language. With both of the techs used,
### the experiment was created nicely and is working well.

## Lessons Learned:
### Going back to coding using the Python language is such a blast because not only is it fun but it is fairly simple than the 
### other languages we've used.
