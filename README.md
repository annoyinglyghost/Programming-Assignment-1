#
## How It's made:
### Tech used: Jupyter Notebook, Python
### The first programming assignment was made using the jupyter notebook and the Python language. The experiment introduces us to basic functions and codes that can be used for python. The experiment was created nicely and is working well with both techs used.
#
## Lessons Learned:
### Going back to coding using the Python language is such a blast because it is fun and fairly simple than the other languages we've used.
